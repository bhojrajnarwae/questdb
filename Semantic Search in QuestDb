QuestDB itself does not provide built-in natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. However, you can integrate with external NLP libraries or services to perform NLP operations within QuestDB.

Here's an example of how you might use the Stanford CoreNLP library to perform NLP operations on text within QuestDB:

SELECT text, sentiment
FROM (
  SELECT text, 
         nl_processing(json_stringify(stanfordnlp(text, 'sentiment'), ''))
           AS sentiment
  FROM my_table
)
WHERE sentiment = 'Positive';

In this example, the stanfordnlp() function is used to analyze the sentiment of the text column within the my_table table. The json_stringify() function is used to convert the results of the stanfordnlp() function to a JSON string, and the nl_processing() function is used to extract the sentiment value from the JSON string.

The nl_processing() function is a custom function that you would need to define to extract the relevant data from the JSON string returned by the NLP library. This function might look something like this:
CREATE FUNCTION nl_processing(input STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT
AS '
  const data = JSON.parse(input);
  return data.sentiment;
';

In this example, the nl_processing() function extracts the sentiment value from the JSON string returned by the stanfordnlp() function.
Here's an example of how you might modify the MySQL query to perform a semantic search in QuestDB:

SELECT * FROM Question WHERE MATCH (QuestionContent) AGAINST ('+semantic +search' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
